# my_master_thesis
Final draft of my master thesis manuscript. Research for master thesis was in the field of theoretical and quantum cosmology, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Claus Kiefer at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Cologne.  
The thesis is titled "On the Utility of the Lorentzian No-Boundary Wavefunction as a Precursor to Inflation". It explores whether a universe described by the Lorentzian no-boundary wavefunction leads to conditions in the very early universe that are favourable for Starobinsky inflation. Refer to the abstract for a more detailed overview.
